<p>A curious and enthusiastic learner balancing my studies in pharmacy with a growing passion for web development. Outside academics, I enjoy immersing myself in books that broaden my perspective, playing football at the academy level to stay disciplined and active, and exploring new music and adventurous experiences that keep my creativity and energy alive. Always eager to take on new challenges and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
